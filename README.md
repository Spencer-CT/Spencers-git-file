        .Eslintric.json
        .gitignore
        README.md
        app.js
        style.css
        index.html


Content is a compliation of a index.html, app.js & style.css "wired" together. It is clean HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with correct indentation and syntax. .toLowerCase() was utilized for the if / else if / else statements. Each commit had a console.log() message that was helpful. CSS was used to style the page. I added a headder & footer to try to explore a bit more with CSS.
